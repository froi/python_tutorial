# A Python tutorial for beginners in Python

This is an experiment on how best to present a programming talk/workshop.

The idea is to have the presentation be done in the exact code taht is going to be presented. This way the attendees can not only follow the presentation but also see that the code works and how it works.

## Running the presentation

Execute: ```python python_presentation.py```

After each block of text the script will wait for the __return__ / __enter__ input to continue.

Take a look at the [video](https://asciinema.org/a/8739) for more info.
